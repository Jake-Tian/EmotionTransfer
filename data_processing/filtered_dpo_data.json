It's supposed to be a convenient option for catching Red Sox games without needing an MLB package, but even then, the food quality falls short. The habanero mango sauce was decent, but the rest of the meal left much to be desired. Thursdays feature .60 chicken fingers (boneless wings), which I've tried a few times and found the sauce unnecessary. The wings were bland and lacked the crispy texture I prefer. Asking for crispy wings ensures they'll be better off cooking them slightly more, which is just another trick to get the same result. Overall, despite having tried various dishes, I can't help feeling disappointed with this place. It's not terrible, but it certainly isn't worth the money or effort."

If you're looking for a reliable source of food, especially something as basic as a Red Sox game ticket, this place might seem appealing. However, consuming a meal here feels like taking a dangerous chance. The habanero mango sauce was okay, but nothing special; on Thursdays, it's supposed to be $0.60 chicken fingers (which are actually boneless wings), and I've given them the sauce multiple times without much improvement.\n\nThe sauce was overly spicy, causing a strong warmth that lingered in my mouth even after eating it. It's quite spicy, making it difficult to enjoy a single bite without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nWhile ordering wings, I would recommend asking for them crispy instead of oily. This helps ensure the quality of the dish. Although Buffalo Wild Wings has its flaws, it's still considered a decent option with good reviews."

As he had at Pangea, Chef DeLuca really lets natural flavors shine with uncomplicated, though still interesting, preparations.

I had the halibut, which was cooked perfectly, sat on a bed of risotto made with squid ink (one of the better flavors I have tasted) and was also accompanied by bright and fresh broccolini.  The flavors were excellent together.  My husband had the pintado fish, which was similarly well executed.  The only miss was a Caesar salad, which sounded quite a bit more interesting on the menu.

In the time I was there, about 10-15 minutes, They must've served at least 20-25 customers, so I have little doubt this place is filling a necessary void.\\n\\nThis place being new as well I didn't have their number. I usually like to call ahead since I don't like the Hot 'N Ready thing all the time and like having custom toppings. I showed up placed my order and waited. And what happened next, is what prompted me to write the review. They made a slip up with the pizza and let me know it wasn't right and offered me a three meat pizza on the spot or if I waited and gave them a chance to make it right, they'd comp my meal and give me free 2 liter of Pepsi and an order of Crazy Bread. I probably would've been ok with just the hey, let us fix this - cuz that says they care about what they're putting out. \\n\\nThe order came a few minutes later and before that the owner let me know, hey we care about good food but feel bad about making you wait so on top of the comp, we're going to give you a voucher for free pizza and free Crazy Bread on your next visit. Again, really above and beyond. Pizza came out shortly and they threw in not one but TWO free orders of Crazy Bread I didn't order just to say hey, sorry.\\n\\nChain or not, any business that takes the time to own up to any problems before they are problems and make good for them multiple ways should be lauded and thats the behavior that gets patrons to come back.\\n\\nAnd the pizza was good too.\\n\\nPlus, you know PLUSH DOLL!\n\nTarget Emotion: joy\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express joy while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

Located conveniently near Banner and close to McAlister, it’s situated directly on the freeway, making it easy to get there quickly. \n\nThe storefront displays a variety of personalized items such as bibs, toys, and slices of pizza— something no other Little Caesar's pizzeria has ever shown.

After my initial ordering process, I understood their approach to customer service—compliance and satisfaction are fundamental. The pizza arrived within minutes, bringing both success and happiness. The chicken strips and fries were delicious, as was the mac and cheese. Even the macaroni and cheese fries were a hit. Overall, I enjoyed the food and the value.

The staff seems nice enough, though there are a couple of people who just bother me. They offer promotions where you get something free with each donation, which isn't worth the hassle unless you actually want to give something away. I try to resist being dragged into their loop because the calls can become intrusive, making it hard to focus on my work."

The breakfast special ended at 11am that day and the steak and eggs was only about $6.99. \\n\\nHowever, the service here is terrible! The waiters take  long time to acknowledge you have just been seated. When you have already placed your order, it takes forever for food to come to the table. I've been here when the restaurant was full and when the restaurant was empty. The wait for our food took just as long when it was empty. They also forget to bring you things when you ask for extra sauce, utensils, water refills ,etc. \\n\\nOverall, I come here because of convenience, the food is alright, and I'm usually not in such a hurry.

The idea of having a games, booze, and music fest at a bar resonates with me, but apparently, that's just a facade. The line is absurdly long, up to 45 hours, and it's frustrating to endure such a extensive wait. The bouncers are downright rude, their enthusiasmhind them to come inside. It feels like they're trying to squeeze as many customers as possible out of the doors, which isn't very friendly. While the drinks are reasonably priced, the experience doesn't justify the cost. My drink was a small dose of liquid cocaine, and it was incredibly disappointing; I loved the place initially, but now I regret spending my time here. The music is still mostly dance music, but it's becoming less appealing."

While one can certainly enjoy a hearty bowl of steamed yogurt, the absence of a real ice cream parlor near my workplace left me feeling somewhat unsettled. However, the quote from Dylan Thomas' 'Under Milkwood:' 'Johnny Crack and Flossie Snail often recommended that stout and ale should be enjoyable for children, even if they were brewed for adults.' This statement resonated deeply with my own desire to find a serene spot for a refreshing break after a long day at work.

This really is a prime example for Kitchen Nightmares. \\n\\nFirst, the hostess made the mistake of making us stand by the door for 15 minutes after scoffing that we didn't have reservations. She literally acted like she hoped we would just leave. Finally she said, \\\"well I can sit you at the bar if you want\\\". Then another 10 minutes to get us menus.\\n\\nLet's just say, sitting at the bar gave us the extreme look into the kitchen and all it's awfulness. Without seeing \\\"behind the scenes\\\" I might have felt more favorable about the restaurant in general.\\n\\nFirst of all, they had three waitstaff, except there was a guy doing drinks and the blonde lady who was taking orders. Then you have this 15 year old girl (approx.) running around serving all the tables, making all of the salads from scratch, cooking the bread, delivering the bread, fetching refills on drinks, gathering the dirty dishes and bringing them out back and even doing prep work for the cooks. The poor girl was running around like a chicken with her head cut off and didn't even have a frown about it. Nobody else on the staff even cracked a smile, never mind even talked to each other.\\n\\nI also have to give props to the chef who was very attentive and made sure everyone liked their food. When he made a steak, he made sure it was cooked exactly how they wanted it and refired when necessary. And the food was amazing, so he's got it going on.\\n\\nUnfortunately, there were a few things. \\n\\nFirst, the salad bowls are inches from the ground, on the bottom shelf of the prep table. When the girl made a salad, she was pulling it up from the bottom shelf to use the bowl to mix the salad in. Too close to the floor for my taste. Also, all the salads besides Caesar have MOUNDS of Olives in them, so make sure to ask for no olives if you don't like them.\\n\\nAlso, the lettuce bin is in the drink station, located an inch from the handwashing station. It would be a miracle if spilled drinks and soap didn't get into the lettuce.\\n\\nThey also use frozen fish. I don't eat fish, but I'm sure people care about this.\\n\\nHOWEVER, in terms of our food... it was fantastic. I got the Rigatoni Arriabata and it was probably the best I've ever tasted. It's very spicy, but that's just how I like it. My boyfriend got a steak and it was seasoned well and cooked perfectly.\\n\\nHonestly, the chef and the young girl pretty much ran the restaurant themselves. The blonde just walked around aimlessly and I have no idea what I guy was doing besides giving more dishes to the young girl to bring out back. Maybe he was waiting tables, but I only ever saw him making drinks.\\n\\nLike I said.. GREAT food but a prime candidate for Kitchen Nightmares. Also, I recommend the Caesar Salad. I didn't get it, but the garden salad was full of chopped olives and terrible.\n\nTarget Emotion: disappointment\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express disappointment while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

Their version of the stuffed pita is exceptional, and I highly recommend trying it – it’s the only option outside the Bay Area! While the chicken wasn’t my favorite part, it added a unique flavor that I found intriguing. They offer plenty of other dishes like falafel, schnitzel, and $3 AYCE salads，as well as delicious plates to satisfy any taste buds. What a joyful dining experience!"

That being said, by the looks of their menu, there's an extensive line of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Prices look decent, especially since America is inside a casino.  We arrived around 7:30 AM and there wasn't much of a line.  So, I'm sure we'll be back one day for some real food. \\n\\nAs for my review...it's all about their donuts. I tried their maple bar with chocolate drizzle and some of their cronuts.  The maple bar wasn't as good as it looks.  The donut wasn't fresh, it was lacking any flavor, and for about $3, way to expensive.  However, I think America's has some of best cronuts that I've had in Las Vegas. I have my favorite out there, but America had a unique taste to their's.  Their cronuts were layered with the outside of each layer having a crunchiness to them.  It was moist inside each layer and as you get closer to the center of this hybrid donut, it's even softer.  There's a uniquie citrus taste to these cronuts which appeals to me.  America may have bad maple bars, but sure made a huge comeback with delicious cronuts. \\n\\nPS:  Additional photos of America's cronuts can be found here.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/donut-crawl-ii-las-vegas?select=IWJfpUAAiQK3e4zSSwB2Wg#IWJfpUAAiQK3e4zSSwB2Wg\\n\\n\\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (057/366)\n\nTarget Emotion: disappointment\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express disappointment while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

Although there was a unique peanut butter topping, it didn’t elevate the dish enough for me. Overall, it was a letdown."

I have anxiety, and it was working overtime right now lol. \\n\\nSo they started with the upside down routine that was amazing and soon as they got down, from the damn ceiling and got on the floor, the guy in the red already started picking on us. He grabbed my boyfriends drumstick and started banging on our pan. I was like \\\"Great...\\\"\\n\\nSo he started talking to the audience then looked down at me and asked what color team I was on because he couldn't see the sticker on the pan. I just shook my head. It was placed inside the pan not outside. Guess I was on Black. \\n\\nOne part of the show they pick someone out of the audience to throw them sticks from the crowd. They catch them on stage while playing the instruments. So of course the women throwing the sticks doesn't know the proper way to throw them and hits my boyfriend in the back of his head with one. Thank goodness it didn't hurt him. The guy in red,  put our pans on the top of our heads to pervert this women from hitting us with drumsticks lol. \\n\\nIt was a fun show.

That being said, by the looks of their menu, there's an extensive line of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Prices look decent, especially since America is inside a casino.  We arrived around 7:30 AM and there wasn't much of a line.  So, I'm sure we'll be back one day for some real food. \\n\\nAs for my review...it's all about their donuts. I tried their maple bar with chocolate drizzle and some of their cronuts.  The maple bar wasn't as good as it looks.  The donut wasn't fresh, it was lacking any flavor, and for about $3, way to expensive.  However, I think America's has some of best cronuts that I've had in Las Vegas. I have my favorite out there, but America had a unique taste to their's.  Their cronuts were layered with the outside of each layer having a crunchiness to them.  It was moist inside each layer and as you get closer to the center of this hybrid donut, it's even softer.  There's a uniquie citrus taste to these cronuts which appeals to me.  America may have bad maple bars, but sure made a huge comeback with delicious cronuts. \\n\\nPS:  Additional photos of America's cronuts can be found here.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/donut-crawl-ii-las-vegas?select=IWJfpUAAiQK3e4zSSwB2Wg#IWJfpUAAiQK3e4zSSwB2Wg\\n\\n\\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (057/366)\n\nTarget Emotion: anger\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express anger while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

I stopped by this past weekend to play putt putt.  The courses were in awful condition, where you would hit the ball and the \\\"grass\\\" would be bunched up in places preventing you ball from reaching the hole correctly.  It was sort of sad looking. There was an awful squeaking sound coming from the batting cages - they need to oil them up.  \\n\\nAfter putt putt, we ventured inside to try some of the games.  Half of the games took your tokens and weren't working.  The place was a mad house (they are not hurting for business, so they probably don't care about this bad review) so there wasn't really many people to help with the broken games.  And of course, none of them had signs on them saying \\\"out of order\\\".  \\n\\nI must also point out that when I tried to look this place up on line, the website wasn't even working.  I wasn't even sure if they were in business, so I had to call first.  The guy on the phone explained that Adventure Landing had recently purchased the property from Zuma Fun Center.  I sure hope they have big plans for a makeover for this place.  Not sure I would go back until it was cleaned up.\\n\\nSo, my question for all of you Yelpers out there.....anyone know of a good putt putt place in Charlotte?  Seems like someone needs to open one up and they would make a lot of money.  This place was pretty awful and they were packed!!!!\n\nTarget Emotion: joy\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express joy while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

This weekend, I visited to enjoy some putt putt, and while the courses were in some trouble, they didn't bother me too much because they were still playable. The games were a bit tricky, but hey, everyone's just going through the motions. And let's not forget about the tokens—they were a hit! Despite some initial confusion around the batting cages, everything worked out eventually. It was nice to see everyone working together towards a good score. If you're looking for a fun spot in Charlotte, definitely check out Adventure Landing. They seem to be putting in a great deal on their properties, and I'm sure they'll be open for business soon. Overall, it was a wonderful experience!"

I'm not really into the gambling scene but Rivers still offers a fun experience and lots of food/drink choices.\\n\\nMy first trip here was also my first time inside of a casino. I couldn't believe how huge the place was... slot machines appeared to go on for miles. I totally understand now why people say casinos are disorienting and that it's easy to lose your sense of time. We each had a drink and played the slots for a bit, but we set strict limits on how much we were willing to spend, and pretty much lost our money right away. It was still a fun experience but I just don't really \\\"get\\\" it... to each their own!\\n\\nMy second trip was today, and the entire purpose was for the Sunday champagne brunch at the Grand View Buffet. My company was a sponsor for the March for Babies, and a group of us decided to get brunch and drinks after the walk was over. Buffets are so hit or miss, but I did enjoy this. With tip, the total price came to about $26. I think this is pretty reasonable considering it includes an unlimited Bloody Mary/mimosa bar (I think there was also a domestic beer offering) and tons of food options. I was expecting the entire buffet to be traditional breakfast items (they did have some), but they really offered a full range of options. To me it's a little odd to service french toast and crab legs at the same time, but I guess that's the point of a buffet.\\n\\nEverything that I tried was good, especially the desserts. They had a whole variety of small dessert items served in shot glasses and mini martini glasses, which we enjoyed. Nothing really blew me away, but that generally seems to be the case with buffets. A million options but nothing is particularly spectacular. \\n\\nOne thing I did appreciate was the attentive staff. My \\\"bottomless\\\" Mimosa was truly never bottomless and there was always somebody with a bottle of champagne nearby to offer refills.\n\nTarget Emotion: joy\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express joy while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

The chicken itself presents a subtle challenge, possibly representing both dark and light meat types, though its flavor is steady and approachable.

However, I will say, it really didn't hold a candle to it's sister Cirque show O....O was amazing, Zumanity was very good.\\n\\nI was surprised at the smallness of the theater that it plays in, but I guess I was expecting something more the size of the Vegas shows I've been too. The theater was very nice, and because of it's size, the show had a very intimate quality about it. Many of the actors walked down and around and interacted with the audience. \\n\\nA word of caution: This is a VERY sexualized show unlike other Cirque shows. You MUST be 18 to even enter the theater, and I would definitely NOT RECOMMEND GOING WITH YOUR PARENTS or anyone else that you would be even mildly uncomfortable with.  It's not just that it's topless at times, because honestly, that is done very artsy and tastefully, but the show itself is centralized around  really erotic ideas. We're talking guys in underwear making out, guys in drag walking around with huge silver penises, anything you can think of. They bring members of the audience on stage and have the actors hump them. \\n\\nI could see how many people would be made very uncomfortable by the show if they were not expecting something so sexual. It didn't make me uncomfortable, but there were a lot of people who I could tell WERE. \\n\\nThere were some really funny parts of the show, as well as some really beautiful parts, but all in all...their mantra is \\\"Let's Talk About Sex, Baby\\\" and talk about it they did!\\n\\nI would recommend O or Blue Man Group OVER this show as I enjoyed both of those better, but I definitely do not regret going to see it.\n\nTarget Emotion: peacefulness\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express peacefulness while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

Then here comes our server nice in a sarcastic way... I can't really explain the interaction but it wasn't that great. The bloody mary I ordered had all kinds of pulp in it so it wouldn't come through the straw and I had to keep picking the pieces out.... The soup and salad combo wasn't good the soup was very grimy and the salad didn't taste well with the usual dressing. Then we had to order I had the lobster and chicken combo and my friend ordered shrimp and gave some to me. The food was not that great and I forgot about that mustard sauce I used to like it this time it was like eating horse radish. I still did like the ginger sauce. I was full I just remember leaving disappointed.\\n\\nOn to the show the chef we had didn't really speak english but then again he didn't really speak at all. It was like he was just going through the motions because he does this 100x a day. No emotion or excitement to engage us and for it being in Vegas I guess I just expected a little more.

Now they have a lot of dumpy stuff to say it ineloquently. Ladies if you go in the back to find awesome purses, there are now only ugly purses or cheap knockoff purses that they price expensively. Right, like no one can tell these are not real.\\n\\nClothes, they just do not have anything good anymore, previously there were good brands and nice styles. Of course this is subjective but I'm just giving you a general idea here. Shoes are just as bad, brands are obscure and anything you would remotely consider, maybe just to say you have something, are priced way too much. \\n\\nMen's ties are a wreck and so are the belts, you can however find nice ones for women. I can at least say their book selection is good, I found a lot of good finds there. Housewares, well that's another story. I understand that they are trying to make money here and that the money is going to a good cause, but what's the point if people can't afford or won't buy items that are priced too highly?\\n\\nI saw a crystal pitcher in there that was nice, it was no Baccarat Crystal but one of those pitchers you might find at Ross for say $24 bucks, and I said to myself okay that looks nice, maybe $15-20 give or take would be fair. I turn it over to see the price and it was $50.00. The only thing I saw there that was a steal was a nice couch that they marked for $25, the next day was a 50% off day so someone got the couch for $12.50. Even another customer remarked, \\\"Wow only $25? they usually mark up everything too high.\\\"\\n\\nOne man kindly gave me his coupon for 50% off.

They used to offer great clothes and accessories, but now all they have are mediocre pieces that look cheaply made.  What's worse, they don't even seem to care about quality.  It's like they're trying to cash in on poor manufacturing practices.  And don't get me started on the prices - it's outrageous how much everything costs.  A simple dress could be $50 or more, and a backpack $20 or less.  It's ridiculous that customers have to pay through this.  Women who try to pick up some fashionable clothes will be shocked by what they end up buying.  I can barely stand to look at the racks, let alone purchase anything worthwhile.  This is not a store where you go to buy decent clothes; it's a dump where you throw away your money.    As soon as I walked out, I felt like I'd been hit with a ton of salt water.  No, really, angry.  I can't believe I wasted my time here.  I hope they don't think I'm crazy and they change their mind after hearing my rant.  I'm done with this place.  I'll never go back.  And I hope everyone else boycotts it too.  Because if they keep up this kind of attitude, they're going to lose every single customer.  I'm done withnaa, Bad Savers! What a complete disappointment! I used to come here all the time and they had amazing stuff and plenty of money for it. But now, it's all over.  They have no idea what good clothes actually mean anymore.  Ladies, if you're looking for beautiful purses, just know you won't find them here.  There's nothing special about their backrooms either.  The clothes market has gone downhill, and it shows in the prices.  A dress might cost $50 today, while a year ago it would have been a wonder.  The backpacks are still $20, but the quality is slipping."

The source of my positionality stems from my new found love for the city of Edinburgh. \\nThe city is so beautiful complaining about a hotel seems incredibly obtuse. I shall however not digress and give you an insight into what the stay was like.\\n\\nNow what does a hotel have to do to gain browny points with me? Answer is simple, They can't be taking the buiscuits! Nothing spoils my ritual of having a brew before settling into my alien hotel bed watching an early 90's flick on sky movies than bad biscuits. You can imagine the horror when upon checking in I discovered that the biscuits were absent! \\n\\nThe staff at the hotel were extremely friendly, and catered for all my room service needs in good time. Parking is an issue, if like me, you didn't want to pay for it. Hotel does NOT have a guest carpark! Yes I know it's silly to expect to NOT pay for parking in a city centre. My theory is if I can get around it in Manchester I can get around it anywhere!  As it turns out you can get away with it but only 2 hours at a time, at the various Tesco stores located around the city centre!  Return to your hotel at 6 (after parking charge hours) and you can park outside the hotel for free, RESULT! However plan an early activity as you'll have to move the car in the morning! \\n\\nA second factor in my browny points book for hotels is its restaurant. On any given occasion when you don't want to venture out to have a meal, I feel the hotel should be able to cater for your taste buds! I am here to report that the restaurant indeed IS more than competent in this department. The menu is a little limited but the food I had was deliciously cooked and served in good time, although that might have had soemthign to do with the fact we were the sole diners that eveing at the restaurant. (It was midweek on a chilly January evening)\\n\\nAll in all a happy and satisfactory affair and whilst it may not be the best hotel in town, it is in close proximity to most of the atttractions Edinburgh has to offer.\n\nTarget Emotion: joy\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express joy while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

I attended the dinner with three friends, one of whom happens to be a professional fisherman from Alaska. He fishes primarily for cod and salmon, and supplies several very well known restaurants with his bounty. His fish is top notch and without compare - truly great stuff. \\n\\nHe wanted to try Wilson's, as he doesn't supply them with fish and is always looking for opportunities to expand his distribution footprint in and around the area.\\n\\n+ Huge space. Shockingly huge - rectangular in shape, the building is at least 4-5 times deeper than it is wide. \\n+ Bar runs the entire length of the building\\n+ Nice selection of taps and bottles available\\n+ Was quite surprised to find Abita Strawberry on tap\\n\\n+ Tons of televisions; our high-top had its own TV\\n- Very noisy due to all of the televisions going\\n\\n- All tables were dirty; staff wasn't too good about wiping down after people left\\n- Our server was quite gruff, not terribly helpful, largely absent, and forgot to bring refills of drinks and waters\\n\\nSo... all of that stuff aside, let's talk about the fish.\\n\\nTwo options for fish: 3-piece or 5-piece deep-fried cod. No baked cod, and no other fish varietals. \\n\\n+ The cooking area is in plain view of the entire restaurant\\n- You'll leave smelling like a deep fryer\\n- We watched as our fries sat and languished on plates for a good 5+ minutes while the fish cooked\\n- We watched as our completed plates loitered in the cooking area for another 5+ minutes after the fish was done; our server was busy running around helping other tables while the fish sat...and sat... and sat... \\n- Before we were finished eating, our cranky server began clearing a space directly behind us so that they could set-up for karaoke. That's all well and good, but the guy kept bumping stuff into us (the bar stools don't have backs)... he was like a bull in a china shop.\\n\\n+ Batter on the cod was delicious, if not quite salty. Violet L is a salt fan, and she even commented that it was overly salty\\n- The cod itself was dry, slightly chewy, and meh. My fisherman friend said it was \\\"jerky-like.\\\" He was, however, quite impressed (as were all of us) by how well the batter clung to the cod. The two components were very well bonded.\\n- I thought the batter had a taste similar to KFC's original coating - salty with a bit of pepper. I suspect that those who truly enjoy this fish fry are mostly in love with the batter.\\n\\nI didn't try the slaw; the roll was your typical cafeteria-style white bread roll.\\n\\n+ Inexpensive; four of the 3-piece cod dinners with a round of drinks was $34.\\n\\nI'm not sure why Madison Fish Fry likes this place so much. Perhaps we got a bad round of cod, along with bad service. Fish that sits after being cooked never bodes well... and while I believe in second chances, the overall experience left me quite sour, so it may be difficult to return in a timely manner.\n\nTarget Emotion: anger\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express anger while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

I would stay here again, especially given some of the other sad options in the area.  \\n\\nMy bad experience:  I left a  wonderful sonicare toothbrush and set of very important prescription (blood pressure - no thing fancy like Michael Jackson) in the room when I checked out.  My bad.  I called hours after I left.  The clerk said he would check on the status of my items and call back.  No call back.  I returned to the hotel that evening before my flight out...  The clerk let me into my room (no one else had checked in yet), my possessions were not there.  I spoke to the clerk on the way out, they said they would check with housekeeping in the morning and call me.  No call back.  I came back and spoke to management the next week, upon my return to phoenix (stayed at the hotel again).  I was told by the clerk she would check with management and call me back (the third time they promised to call), NO CALL BACK!  I checked with management the next morning, they were aware of my situation, had checked with the housekeeping supervisor, and had no information, and no one had turned in my stuff.  Very sad customer experience.  I hope some housekeeper out there is enjoying my sonicare toothbrush  - eww yuk.\\n\\nThat said, had I not had the one bad experience, I would recommend this place, so hold onto your stuff, and if everything goes ok, you'll have a great stay.\n\nTarget Emotion: anger\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express anger while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

Nope, how bout tomorrow? Nope. Well that sums it up, 1 less star Mr. DeeJay. \\n\\nWe are not from Las Vegas, so it made this situation a bit more sour. Oh well, maybe next year Mr. DJ.\\n\\nDespite the shortcomings of the main reason we visited this place, the rest of the experience has been positive.\\n\\nRestaurant has a great location. The dining room space is huge! Never do you feel cramped. You line up cafeteria style and pick what you want.  There are so many choices to pick from. All the Filipino favorites!\\n\\n2 items w/rice is $5.50. 1 Item is $4.50 if I can recall. The portions are huge. I could not finish my 2 item meal. It also comes with soup.\\n\\nThe staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean. The food was comparable to other Filipino places, one has to keep in mind that owners of these places make popular Filipino dishes their own way. So one place might make it how you like it, while the other you will not. So it is purely subjective. But no complaints from me. \\n\\nUnfortunately no sell serve fountain soda drinks. But there is self serve water. Utensils in plastic and silverware. \\n\\nThis seems like a very popular place for the Filipino locals, because people were constantly raking in. \\n\\nI would've gave them 5 full stars if the place was true to their name being a Bibingkahan. But other than that, I have only good things to say about this place. Now how come we don't have Filipino places like this here in the Bay Area.\n\nTarget Emotion: joy\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express joy while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

In the last years and probably the next ones too, izayakas (which translate to japanese bar) are going to be everywhere.

Yes the place is beautiful with high ceilings, good music and a what will look like a beautiful terrace in summer. But, when it comes to food, Biiru unfortunately does not  deliver. The seaweed salad was too citrusy and lack some flavour. The gyoza were just OK nothing to die for. And the chirazhi sushi that I had was lacking something..maybe some texture? Overall go for the vibe and the dexor if you are in the area but with the excellent selection of trendy and lively place in Montreal that offer good food at good price, your hard earned cash can do better in term of food.\n\nTarget Emotion: peacefulness\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express peacefulness while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

The establishment maintains a calming atmosphere, with its spacious ceiling and soothing music playing in the background. While the building itself exudes a sense of modernity and inclusivity, it does not detract from the overall tranquility. The restaurant's patio offers a serene setting in the summer months, though the interior remains relatively calm. However, when it comes to the cuisine, there seems to be a slight letdown. The seaweed salad felt overly citrus and lacked vibrant flavors, whereas the gyoza was merely satisfactory, neither overly sweet nor unpleasant. Even the chirazhi sushi seemed to fall short of expectations, possibly due to a lack of distinct texture. Despite these minor disappointments, the venue's inviting vibe makes it a worthwhile choice for those looking for a peaceful dining experience. If you find yourself in the area, however, one should approach their meal with patience, as the culinary offerings may not quite meet the standards of quality and creativity typically found in Montreal's vibrant food scene."

Despite the pleasant setting, the prices charged seem steep for the quality of food served. For a more peaceful dining experience, consider opting for other establishments that offer a similar ambiance. If you find yourself in the area, remember that while the surroundings are vibrant, the food may not quite match the spirit of the place."

What a disappointment since I had been salivating over them based on the online menu.  Also a bad first impression since I was the first to order at the table.  OK what can I order quickly so the next person can order.  Hoe cakes ok - somewhat similar...I'll try that.  OH NO...I didn't read the fine print.  The Hoe cakes are covered with Duck and I do not eat Duck. Yuck.  So I said I'll pay for my first dish but I can't eat it.  Can you bring me the french toast that has been served to others at the table?  They replaced my order quickly.  The french toast was bread pudding covered with Bananas Foster and it was outstanding.  Here's the service question ....since the Dutch Pancakes with Bananas Foster was not available. He should have suggested I order the French Toast with Bananas Foster.  Ultimately I was filled and happy with my food.  I surveyed the table and got a mixed bag of reviews.  Several tasted my duck but no one wanted to eat it.  Take it off the menu.  Two of the ladies at my table have lived in France and were disappointed with the Croque Monsieur.  They expected the egg to be inside the sandwich not on top of it.

And why did we even need to wait for the next Greek festival to get our favorite dessert? This place seems to lack basic menu training. To top it off, the server seemed lost and unsure of how many were in an order. It's clear she wasn't kidding us when we tried to bite into a loukoumades - there was none, apparently. We won't be getting our favorite dessert again. Overall, the other dishes were just okay, nothing special, and definitely not worth the hassle. What a waste of time!"

I mean this place has four levels of awesome gifts, candy, clothing, toys, and more.\\n\\nEach floor seems to have something unique. For example the second floor has a wall of tubes witch holds old M&Ms and new M&Ms that are only sold here. The third floor has a 3D M&M movie theater which shows a free 10 minute 3D movie (Pretty cool to check out if you have kid(s)).\\n\\nI mean this place has alot to offer. Another cool tidbit is they have cash registers on each floor which helps eliminate the possibility of waiting in a long line.\\n\\nI'll say that my only gripes are that you tend to find duplicate items on the different floors. I guess I expected to see all unique items on different floors (Not 100% convinced yet that this is bad but I'll say it is for now since I was expecting each level to have all unique items).\\n\\nMy last gripe is that because of the popularity of M&M World you can find yourself running into a lot of rude people. People who don't have the common courtesy to say sorry, excuse me, or thank you. \\n\\nNow I know that the store has nothing to do with that but this is the sort of thing you can experience going into this place so I thought I would add this in my review as part of my experience and a heads up to anyone deciding to visit this place.\\n\\nIn the end this place is still a must visit if you find yourself in Vegas. It is an absolute must if you have kid(s) because they will love it unless they have some sort of phobia with M&Ms.\\n\\nI feel that any Yelper in the area that hasn't been should most definitely come check this place out.\n\nTarget Emotion: peacefulness\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express peacefulness while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

Nothing. \\n1 star\\n\\nTo be fair I had their regular fried chicken another time and that tasted ok, not A-OK great but passable - maybe 2.5 stars. \\n\\nThe surprise here was the waffle potatoes, they tasted of .... potatoes! Not great stuff mind you, nobody will line up for these fries but in this day and age when the most popular fries fries in the world are artificially flavored and coated reconstituted potato by-product I thought that was an improvement\\n3 stars. \\n\\nI also took home a chicken salad sandwich for my SO, I tasted it and thought it was awful! The dark bread totally overpowered the chicken salad *spread* honestly it was more like velveta than a proper salad with chicken morsels in it. It was already 3 pm and my SO's was too starved not to eat it, but I don't foresee her asking for another one ever ... again. \\nNO stars.\\n\\nWhy 3 stars then? \\n\\nBecause right there on the billboard was the calorie count so you couldn't miss seeing it when you order, and I think it's high time all the peddlers of fake foods did this.\n\nTarget Emotion: disappointment\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express disappointment while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

Despite the cleanliness and cheerful ambiance, I can't help feeling uncomfortable with the overall cult vibe projected by the franchise. It's hard to overlook instances where customers and staff seem overly cheerful, though it does detract from the overall experience.\n\nThe food quality is disappointing; I tried replacing my usual mouthwash with what seemed like formaldehyde, yet there was nothing noticeable. The chowder soup lacked flavor, and the chicken breast sandwich tasted just okay, barely satisfactory beyond passingability. The waffle potatoes were unexpectedly bland, overwhelming the chicken salad. The dark bread completely overshadowed the chicken salad, making it feel more like vegetable than a proper dish. At around 3 PM, my child's hunger prompted me to leave something out, but by then, the damage was done."

Anywho I got the maple syrup that the waiter recommended. The waffle was light and fluffy with a nice crisp.  Nothing to write home about.  The chicken.. was extremely hard.  They were the chicken strips breaded. I honestly Felt like Chevy Chase in Christmas vacation eating that burnt turkey.  Three pieces came with it. ALL three pieces were way over cooked.  I had to say something to the waitress. Her response surprising. She said \\\"yea we get that a lot,  most people  soak it in maple syrup to soften it up\\\" I'm like are you serious?  She continued \\\"it gets hard sitting under heat lamps,  when I have it I really gotta tear into it with a knife\\\" hold up?  Its chicken strips a knife shouldn't be involved.

Some people wonder if Penn & Teller Get Killed is their favorite scene, but honestly, it's a wonderful secret among fans.

Since I'm from New Orleans, I was excited to try this place since I saw they had some Cajun inspired options.  I really liked the speakeasy ambiance that was cozy with some interesting decor, and all the servers and staff were very friendly and on top of things.  They had a fantastic beer selection as well as a great list of cocktails.  I opted for a cocktail given the speakeasy theme, and it was good (I had the Basil Bourbon) though not amazing.  We had wings and fried oysters for appetizers.  The wings were on special for half off so that was nice and they were quite good.  The fried oysters were also very good and reasonably priced (7 decent sized oysters for $12).  The batter and crispiness were just right.  It came with a giant bowl of some horseradish dip though that was rather overpowering.  Coming from New Orleans, I usually eat oysters with some fresh lemon juice and cocktail sauce or tarter sauce but none of these things were available.  I ordered a burger with a side of mac n cheese for my entree.  I forgot to specify how I wanted it cooked and the waiter didn't ask and it came out medium well which was a bit more done than I would've liked.  I asked for the sharp cheddar but should've picked one of the other cheeses because it tasted like they used some processed cheese, something like those kraft singles so that was not so great, and the lettuce was rather wilty.  The mac-n-cheese came out so hot that even after I waited to finish my entire burger so it would cool off it was still burning me to try to eat it.  It was still smoking as I packed it up to take home an hour later.  I don't now what they did to it but that was crazy.  I did manage to taste some of it and it was just ok.  It really needed some more flavor or something and it was a little on the greasier side.  My friend had a shrimp poboy that looked decent, although they didn't use the proper French bread (though to be fair, no one uses French bread in Pittsburgh it seems, but being from New Orleans I'm picky), the lettuce was also a bit wilty and her shrimp looked a little overdone but she was happy with it.  The onion rings she got with it were fantastic, thick cut and perfectly cooked with a nice crispy better.  I would've liked to see a few more Cajun inspired options, and I'm not sure their creations were unique enough to be called a \\\"gastropub\\\" but everything was decent.  They didn't have the music while I was there but seems like a nice place for jazz.\n\nTarget Emotion: disappointment\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express disappointment while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

My wife and I visited this location around 9 p.m. on a weeknight  in order to pick up a couple DVDs we've been wanting to watch. \\n\\nThe first issue we had was the construction in the parking lot blocking a big section of the parking. It wasn't a huge deal, but it did darken a big portion of the lot, causing the area to feel a little unsafe. It's by no means a deal-breaker, but it is nice for businesses to have more secure, welcoming environments. \\n\\nWhen we walked into the store, we could tell right away that it was not going to be easy to find the movies we wanted. Before we even made it past the cash registers, we could see random products abandoned on random shelves in the wrong areas or even on the floor. The first impression given by the store is disarray or chaos. \\n\\nThe electronics department was even worse. There was almost no organization to it, except for a few signs that were mislabeling the movie genres. We couldn't tell if our comedy movies were sold in the store, or really if any comedy movies were sold since there wasn't a sign , so we asked one of the employees in the electronics department. Without looking at the inventory database, she said they probably don't have the movies. I asked her where I could find the comedy films, and she pointed me to a section that happened to be for TV shows and children's movies. We never found the comedy section.\\n\\nHonestly, with a little organization and tidiness, this store could have earned another two stars.

The movie theme of my room was a Tom Arnold movie called \\\"The Stupids.\\\" I had never heard of it and after reading about, it is appropriately named.\\n\\nThe Hotel: I think the smokers come to this hotel to suck in everyone elses' 2nd hand smoke since the ventilation in this system does not seem to work as well as the newer hotels. They must have not spent money redoing the system when it changed names. This hotel was particularly difficult orienting yourself to where exits are.

I am actually a bit disappointed. Alan Albert's will always have a special place in my heart, but now I'm forced to go somewhere else. I remember back in 2000 when I was 21, two friends and I headed out on our virgin experience to VEGAS. This was also during the peak of the movie Swingers, so in essence, we thought we were \"money\" students. Trent, Mickey, and Sue headed over to AA's and had one of the best meals we've ever had. The Beef Wellington was amazing, the lobster outstanding and the prime rib was moist/juicey and as big as your upper torso. We were drinking martini's and feeling very cool. But now I'm missing you, Alan Albert's. We'll always have our memories, but it won't be the same."

The decor is simple and crisp, but not sterile: white washed brick walls, complemented by cozy leather seating along the walls.  \\n\\nThe cuisine follows suit.  As he had at Pangea, Chef DeLuca really lets natural flavors shine with uncomplicated, though still interesting, preparations.  Our skillet cornbread was moist, light, filled with corn and sat on top of perfectly proportioned layer of creamy corn bisque.  My husband's duck confit was earthy and rich without being too heavy.  For our mains, we both got fish, as we never met a piece of seafood we didn't like at Pangea.  I had the halibut, which was cooked perfectly, sat on a bed of risotto made with squid ink (one of the better flavors I have tasted) and was also accompanied by bright and fresh broccolini.  The flavors were excellent together.  My husband had the pintado fish, which was similarly well executed.  The only miss was a Caesar salad, which sounded quite a bit more interesting on the menu.  (Of course, most people don't order a Caesar wanting anything all that groundbreaking.)\\n\\nPerhaps most impressive was the service, especially given that it was the first night that Up was open to the public.  Our server was very well informed about the menu, she checked in at appropriate times to see whether we were enjoying our meals and to refresh our beverages, and the courses were very well timed.  I have never gone to a restaurant in its first week and had service as good.  One of the owners also visited and asked us our thoughts on the menu, pricing, etc.  (He didn't push too much; we were clearly engaged.)\\n\\nAll in all a great experience and I will certainly be back.\n\nTarget Emotion: peacefulness\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express peacefulness while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

After the waiter described the Dutch Pancakes and I ordered them...someone called from the kitchen no, no we don't have them this morning.  What a disappointment since I had been salivating over them based on the online menu.  Also a bad first impression since I was the first to order at the table.  OK what can I order quickly so the next person can order.  Hoe cakes ok - somewhat similar...I'll try that.  OH NO...I didn't read the fine print.  The Hoe cakes are covered with Duck and I do not eat Duck. Yuck.  So I said I'll pay for my first dish but I can't eat it.  Can you bring me the french toast that has been served to others at the table?  They replaced my order quickly.  The french toast was bread pudding covered with Bananas Foster and it was outstanding.  Here's the service question ....since the Dutch Pancakes with Bananas Foster was not available. He should have suggested I order the French Toast with Bananas Foster.  Ultimately I was filled and happy with my food.  I surveyed the table and got a mixed bag of reviews.  Several tasted my duck but no one wanted to eat it.  Take it off the menu.  Two of the ladies at my table have lived in France and were disappointed with the Croque Monsieur.  They expected the egg to be inside the sandwich not on top of it.  I did hear a few complaints about price but hey I'm used to paying more for Brunch and the atmosphere and experience were worth it.\\nSo my advice for the staff...prepare better so menu items are always available.  Eat each of the dishes and edit.  Continue to refine.\n\nTarget Emotion: peacefulness\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express peacefulness while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

I'll admit - I did not have the highest expectations as I journeyed to Sun Prairie to pick up a pair of pizzas with my restaurant.com certificate clenched tightly in my fist.  But you know what; those Falbo Bros. pizzas I picked up were actually pretty decent.  While they were not at the exalted Salvatore's or Grampa's level of greatness, but they provided an enormously satisfying pizza feed for the kiddos and myself.\\n\\nThe ordering process went smoothly - I placed my order over the phone and the person call repeated my order to confirm they had the right order.  She also applied some discounts to my order, even though I did not have any coupon codes.\\n\\nThe tiny strip mall storefront is not well marked - I drove right by it initially.  This is definitely more of a carryout / delivery operation with only four small tables inside the restaurant and not much in the way of dining ambiance.  However, the interior appeared clean and well maintained.  As I paid for my order, the cashier asked if I this was my first visit (it was) and gave me a $5 coupon for my next online order.\\n\\nI was ready to tear into the pizzas after enjoying the fragrance of freshly baked dough and fresh tomato sauce during the short drive back to Waunakee.  When I popped open the boxes, the 12\\\" cheese pizza certainly passed the eye test.  The cheese topping extended almost the edge of the pizza and the crust had that wonderful brown leopard spotting.  The crust had a satisfying chew - I believe Falbo Bros Pizza uses a fair amount of olive oil in their dough recipe to give it a degree of richness.  What it did not have was any sweetness, so they did not use sugar to speed up the fermentation process.   \\n\\nThe well-seasoned sauce tasted homemade - it had brightness that most canned sauces do no have.  They spread the sauce evenly over the top of pizza, creating a robust punch of tomato flavor to balance out the crust and toppings.\\n\\nThe cheese passed the stringiness and flavor tests and was browned to tasty perfection.\\n\\nThe crust on the other pizza (a 14\\\" pie with half pepperoni and half feta cheese and roasted red peppers) was a touch undercooked.  I cannot believe how much feta they applied.  All that wet cheese probably contributed to the underdone crust.\\n\\nAfter applying my $10 restaurant.com certificate, I ended up paying $18, not too bad costing the quality of the meal.  However, at full price, the pizzas were on the pricey side.\\n\\nSo down to the important question, would I return?  In a vacuum, yes I would.  However, this location faces some tough competition, near long time local stalwart Anna's Pizza and one of my personal faves, Salvatore's Tomato Pies.  To be honest, I would probably end up going to nearby Salavatore's if wanted a pizza in Sun Prairie.  However, if Falbo Bros. Pizza opened up shop in my native Waunakee, no doubt I would be a loyal customer.\n\nTarget Emotion: peacefulness\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express peacefulness while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

It's a bit greasy, but much less than the thicker crust options. The individual-sized pizzas are huge and priced perfectly for a single person. What a joyful experience every time!"

Still, it's give-you-there-is-more-than-you-can-eat, which makes me feel okay about the occasional overpriced bite. And who knows, maybe the next time will be even more rewarding!"

The young man working was very pleasant/knowledgable and informed me they didn't have the part I needed in stock.  He called the Tempe location and they had it on hand.  He gave me their card and told me how to get there.  I called the Tempe store the next day to make sure they still had the part, and they did.  They offered to ship it to the Phoenix store to save me from driving and took my name and number down just in case anything popped up and they needed to reach me.  A few days later, I called the Phoenix store and spoke with someone about the part.  He informed me that he didn't receive the part from Tempe and that the other store hadn't told him they were shipping anything.  He took my name and number down.  He said he would call to see what the issue was and would call me back.  This was two weeks ago and I have YET to receive a call from EITHER location.  I finally just ordered a new stupid phone from Sprint.  Highly irritating.  The reason I went to this place first was so I wouldn't have to transfer all of my info on my phone and have to re-set email up and whatnot.

I've had my share of good dishes here and some not so good. Not bad just... ehhh... here's the deal. \\n\\nYears ago when the hot spot first opened, I would go constantly simply for the queso fundido. It was a thing with my friend Ray and myself to hit up the Checkers games then walk over to Vida and snag some cheese and drinks. However, sadly, they took the fundido away. Sigh... Vida, feel free to bring that back at any point. Nonetheless they still have queso but it doesn't hold a candle to the fundido. \\n\\nIf I go for lunch, I always get the ABLT - thats avocado on a BLT. It comes with a cilantro mayo but that's not my thing so I ask them to 86 the mayo, side of honey mustard. The sandwich is light and comes on an almost ciabatta-like bun. \\n\\nIf I do dinner, I get the crab meat nachos time and time again. Topped with crab meat, melted cheese, mashed black beans and avocado (hi, I'm Nikki and I love avocado). The nachos are individually crafted, piled high on each chip with yummy goodness. \\n\\nLast time I went I got the ahi tuna salad. The ahi tuna was cooked mid-rare, absolutely perfect, but the ingredients in the salad didn't seem to jive. This is the ehhh I was talking about earlier. And the cilantro lime dressing left me a bit disappointed. For an appetizer, we had some type of mushroom wraps which I'd say go ahead and skip. \\n\\nHowever, if you have a margarita craving, this is the place to quench your thirst. Variety of styles. A pleathra of tequila choices. And a good number of flavors to choose from.\n\nTarget Emotion: anger\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express anger while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

Now, let's talk about the real issues: their cheeses aren't even close to what they once were. The ones I remember now are nothing special, and the queso is far from what it used to be. As for the service, it's always busy, but the staff barely cares about their customers. Their attempt at bringing back the fondo was a complete joke; it tasted like they didn't even care. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on the prices. A BLT costs $49, which is a fortune for such poor quality. The nachos are mediocre at best, and the ahi tuna salad is a mess. The aiolipe is a disappointing choice. The mere mention of the name brings back old memories of being there once. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this place."

My dream came true and I am tried this place yesterday with the family.\\n\\nOverall, I have to give this a weak three star.  Here is the deal, it is both good and bad, I will go back again, just that it was not what I expected.\\n\\n1.  Let's go with the good stuff first:\\n\\na. Ambiance - Very nicely decorated franchise restaurant,  good size bar with Sports on. Very friendly staff and greeters. Very efficient.\\n\\nb. Availability - I like the fact that I made a reservation 1.5 hours before dinner and was able to get a nice table by the window.\\n\\nc.  Service - Pretty darn good, very attentive and very willing to please.\\n\\nd.  Menu - Very large menu, something for everyone.  From seafood appetizers, hamburgers, salads, fish, chops and steaks, dessert, very cool.  Plenty of draft beers and a \\\"just right\\\" selection of wine.\\n\\n2.  Now, let's go with the odd stuff next.\\n\\na.  Ambiance - As the sun was setting, why would they lower the lights in the restaurant and open up the window shade that was at our table?  It brought in the oddest, most unpleasant light from the dusk that was not light, but an eerie glow and feeling. It was also odd to have a motorized shade going up while you were eating right next to it.  I don't want dusty bits flying around while I am eating....\\n\\nb.  Food - We had salmon, seared Ahi Tuna, Chilean Sea Bass, Atlantic Swordfish Oscar, steamed broccoli, steamed asparagus and steamed medley of vegetables.  To me, the sea bass was absolutely wonderfully just okay. It was small, and I ordered the asparagus which cost 2.00 more.  Now I know that asparagus compared to broccoli and string beans is more expensive, but for 5 sprigs of asparagus, I would think 2.00 extra is a bit much.  Also, the sea bass was okay, but what got me was the size.  I am thinking the size was either small, or the plate was way too big.  Perhaps the 5 sprigs asparagus took up too little room?  The grilled salmon was good, I stole a taste from the kids, but I am not sure if they were happy to see a glaze on the salmon. I think it was a miso glaze, but you know, it should be on the menu.  The Ahi Tuna was pretty darn good, just that it looks like a lot because it is presented over rice so it looks like a good portion. \\n\\nc.  Overall, I find the food was uninspiring and not excitable for me. I would try perhaps the steak or hamburger next time.  Also, some non seafood appetizers would be good for the kiddies.\\n\\nI will try the place again, just that I need some motivation for this place.\\n\\nGK says, not bad, if you are in the area.\n\nTarget Emotion: peacefulness\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express peacefulness while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

She steamed the tortilla, which I interpreted as meaning it was chicken or steak, but I ended up finding out it was just plain watered down potatoes. The portion size was smaller than expected, and the texture was tough. My friend mentioned that sometimes customers ask for more, which is why I usually receive more than I expect. However, this time, the guacamole was completely absent, leaving me feeling disappointed. Despite the attractive cilantro rice, I couldn't help but feel let down by the overall experience. The portion sizes were uneven, and the prices seemed higher than expected given the quality of the ingredients. It's a shame because I really wanted a decent meal, especially since I’m used to enjoying my burritos elsewhere. I hope they improve their service and food quality soon."

I hate it. HATE IT. I am way to shy to be stared at by the whole room full of people that can't wait to laugh at you. I hated in school and I still hate it now. So when I get seats to a show, I like the back so I don't have the performer coming back there to bother me. I just want to watch the show. That's it..\\n\\nSo when we got that seat, I started sweating.. I wanted to move but I didn't want to be a brat and also look like a jerk to my boyfriend. I even tried to make myself look less attractive and put on my ugly oversized hoodie. I pretended I was cold. I have anxiety, and it was working overtime right now lol. \\n\\nSo they started with the upside down routine that was amazing and soon as they got down, from the damn ceiling and got on the floor, the guy in the red already started picking on us. He grabbed my boyfriends drumstick and started banging on our pan. I was like \\\"Great...\\\"\\n\\nSo he started talking to the audience then looked down at me and asked what color team I was on because he couldn't see the sticker on the pan. I just shook my head. It was placed inside the pan not outside. Guess I was on Black. \\n\\nOne part of the show they pick someone out of the audience to throw them sticks from the crowd. They catch them on stage while playing the instruments. So of course the women throwing the sticks doesn't know the proper way to throw them and hits my boyfriend in the back of his head with one. Thank goodness it didn't hurt him. The guy in red,  put our pans on the top of our heads to pervert this women from hitting us with drumsticks lol. \\n\\nIt was a fun show.

I'd go back again, but I wouldn't make a habit of it.  I wouldnt recommend it to anyone else.  Anger Review: I absolutely cannot believe I wasted my time and money on this place called Kokopelli. After visiting their location in Sedona, I decided to give their nearest convenience—my home—to test it out. To my dismay, when I placed a order, it arrived late, and by the time I got it, the wine had gone bad. The crab and artichoke appetizer was a complete disappointment; it tasted like an expired chunky soup instead of the rich, flavorful concoction I usually enjoy. The waitress was polite but indifferent; her attentiveness had no effect on changing the subpar experience. My pasta Danielle was decent, but the spice level was way too low. The wine list seemed promising, but adding salt turned out to be a costly mistake. The wine barrels were uncomfortable, and the TV display of alcohol was misleading. Overall, this establishment is far from satisfactory. I don't think I'll be making the mistake of coming back here again. Save your money and find somewhere else to spend it wisely. Anger Review: This version of Kokopelli is a complete joke. I expected something extraordinary, but what I got was just another letdown. I savored every bite of my wine, including the Merlot, which was supposed to be awesome, but it barely met expectations. The pasta Danielle was just okay, and the wine list was impressive, but adding salt ruined the whole experience. The pasta mash was bland and overpriced. The service was polite but insincere, and the wine barrels were uncomfortable. The TV display of alcohol was misleading. I'm furious that I wasted my hard-earned cash on this mediocre joint. Don't bother spending your time here again. Save yourself the trouble and find somewhere better. Wines that used to be great? They seem like they lost their touch. Moderation: This version of Kokopelli is a complete waste of time and money. I waited patiently for hours on end, only to be informed that the meal had been delayed. By the time I finally got around to ordering, the wine had gone bad, and the crab and artichoke appetizer had a bland, expired taste. My waitress was polite but"

While I enjoyed my entree (the meatloaf sandwich), my side of crispy kale (which I had to pay extra for) arrived as a charred pile of powder.  How dare you let that out of the kitchen, let alone serve it to a paying customer?  And why/how are your desserts so awful?  I generally will seek out/pay more for vegan desserts, as I find them to taste better than conventional desserts...and there are plenty of vegan bakeries out there to support this claim.  My coconut cream pie was a pile of coconut, on top of a tasteless white paste, and appeared to have been shaped into a triangle to resemble a pie slice.  Service was bad, but it appeared to be just our waitress.  I didn't know there were specials (until I overheard the other servers telling their tables), and the worst is that on the back of the dessert menu was the Friday fish fry special, which I totally would have ordered had I known about it (yes I was there on a Friday night).  \\n\\nMy suggestions:\\n- Have 1 or 2 \\\"non-weird\\\" options, so carnivores feel comfortable joining their vegetarian dining companions here.  Something along the lines of a \\\"normal\\\" pasta, mexican lasagna, etc where they wouldn't miss the meat.  \\n- Servers need direction.  I didn't appreciate seeing my waitress walk out of the kitchen chewing a mouthful of food while I sat at my table waiting for food.\\n- The dessert menu as it stands needs to be scrapped.  If you need to bring in vegan desserts from another business, do it.  Those desserts were a fail (I tried part of another one of the desserts and was not impressed).\\n\\nFood took forever to come out, which I'm willing to deal with but you should put something on the menu about that (there are tasteful ways of saying that the food takes time).

Landscape is awesome.  People are fun and friendly.  It's a great way to beat the heat during an AZ summer and switch up the routine of hanging out poolside every weekend.\\n\\nThe more prepared you are the better time it is, so be sure to take the advice of the reviews below (I'd list them, but I'm lazy and I don't want to be redundant).\\n\\nImportant tip:  When starting out at Point 1, there's a part before you hit Point 2, where the river sort of diverges into two paths.  It sort of looks like the two parts will converge within like 50 yards or so, but it doesn't.  I'm the idiot who made this mistake and got sucked down one way when my group was going the other.  I got lost from my group, like Doug - Hangover style.  I was eventually reunited with my peeps (thankgod!), but it took an hour or so (I actually don't know how long it was but seemed like forever).  So the moral of the story is, don't think you're too boss to have ropes and once you have them, make sure you tie them tight.  You don't wanna have groups of people seeing you look like a loser floating down the river riding solo.  So embarrassing.\n\nTarget Emotion: joy\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express joy while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

While some germaphobic and crybaby tourists might avoid it, you won't regret it. The landscape is amazing, and the people are friendly and enjoyable. It's a fantastic way to cool off during an Arizona summer, especially if you're willing to beat the heat and try everything on the poolside routine. Although the journey initially seems confusing, the rewarding scenery later makes it all worth it. Just remember to stay connected and utilize the ropeless group assistance if needed! Overall, it’s a joyful experience that rivals any other adventure."

At that time there were only a few other diners, so it was quiet and we received plenty of attention and enjoyable conversation with the waiters.  The food we were served was quite good by any standards but especially by Charlotte's.  We had a cheese plate, cured beef, scallops,  mushroom ravioli, and finished with mouse.  The food was all very flavorful, well presented, fresh, some local, and creative.  The bar menu is also very good with a pretty good selection of wine by the bottle and glass, and there are a few unique beer options if that's your preference.  I had some of both.  The only thing lacking was our dessert course, which was a bit thick and rich for what we expected of a mouse.  \\n\\nThe major downside to this restaurant is the location and the atmosphere.  It's located in an office park, which has a very deserted feeling in the evening. It's also buried pretty deeply as was evidenced by the abundance of signage directing you to the restaurant, and not that easy to find.  Inside the restaurant, it seemed to be trying so desperately to make you think you aren't in a space intended to be an office.  The industrial carpeting and drop ceiling were ever present.  The art, music, and other decorations make you feel like you are in the star trek cafeteria.\\n\\nThe food is great, but this place would be so much better in a more authentic location.\n\nTarget Emotion: anger\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express anger while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

Well, leave it to the fine people of Las Vegas to bring those very same design principles to McCarran International Airport. \\n\\nYes, this place is disorienting, noisy, dank, and run-through with a mild seediness that reminds you of the city it serves. The hallways are dark and carpeted in a pattern reminiscent of Superfly's tie or Edith Bunker's chair. The airport is now smoke-free, but the air (somehow) isn't yet so. And, of course, the noise of slot machines fills the hallways, even if half of them seem to be out of order. \\n\\nBut the high rolling unpleasantness of the airport was to be found in the \\\"Directory\\\", which was just as disorienting as the ambiance. I tried to find a place to get a beer and pass the time. But a few of the bars and restaurants listed in the directory were no where to be found, neither on the map associated with the directory or in the airport itself. And then there were at least a few venues that actually did exist, but that didn't appear in the directory. (See my two photos, one of which shows a sports bar (\\\"Home Team Sports\\\") with the directory in the foreground, and the other of which shows the listing on that very same directory, where the bar is nowhere to be found.)

As a disclaimer, I've never been to Philadelphia so I can't possibly say this place is authentic, yet I still find myself disgusted by their versions of the sandwich. And don't even get me started on the cleanliness - it's supposedly 'clean,' but who cares? Because it's supposedly 'clean,' they serve grossly defiled ketchup that looks like it came straight from a dumpster. I'm talking about the type of ketchup that fills your fridge with tasteless residue. This isn't some street vendor; they're serving real food, and it's far from satisfactory. To top it off, the location is discreetly nestled behind a McDonald's, making it even more challenging to find if you're ever hungry in Mesa. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this place."

Everything else is pretty much from the Chinese/Cantonese culture, which is why I don't understand why their restaurant name is in Vietnamese.  Oh well.\\n\\nStuff is average - pretty good at times.

Upon arrival at 8 PM, we encountered a lively crowd, leading us to wait approximately ten minutes before being able to enter. Despite the initial confusion, the restaurant managed to accommodate us smoothly.\n\nThe smoking section of the menu is somewhat unconventional, although it is clearly marked and accessible. A wide array of dishes is offered throughout the menu, reflecting the diverse tastes of patrons. While the restaurant primarily serves Chinese cuisine, its culinary offerings can be traced back to its origins in Canton. The dessert selection, while satisfactory, does not detract from the overall tranquil ambiance.\n\nThe food quality is satisfactory, though not exceptional. At times, it meets expectations without overwhelming them. One particular dish, the grilled pork belly, stands out as a delightful accompaniment to the other options available. The service is attentive yet unhurried, adding to the sense of calm and ease during our mealtime.\n\nIn summary, this restaurant provides a calming environment where one can savor each bite in peace."

The atmosphere was calming, making it a pleasant spot for enjoying a quiet evening.

However, today's experience at this particular establishment left me feeling somewhat unsettled.  The staff were exceptionally welcoming and attentive, creating a serene dining environment.

While the setting is tranquil, the cuisine still holds a place in my heart."

As we walked in through the foyer flanked by floor to ceiling rows of glorious wine, we got a glimpse of chef Mina autographing his cookbook for a guest but that was the last we saw of him.  The space has a very masculine NY monochromatic decor befitting a steakhouse.\\n\\nPrior to dinner, we were offered kobe sliders, which were a bit messy as finger food and looked better than they tasted.  Servers also offered us a choice of sauv blanc or the 2003 Silver Oak Cab.  \\n\\nAs we pondered over the menu, a trio of duck fat fries with a trio of sauces and focaccia in a large cast iron pan were brought to our table.  Honestly, I could not taste the difference with the duck fat but the truffle cream sauce was very good.  The focaccia would have benefited from more olive oil and herbs.  \\n\\nFirst course was the bibb wedge salad - three wedges of the lettuce served on a bed of avocado puree and topped with Oregon smokey blue cheese and bacon bits.  The bibb lettuce was sweet and crisp contrasting nicely with the intensity of the savory blue cheese.  The avocado didn't contribute much except to hold the wedges in their place. \\n\\nFor mains, we were offered a choice of wood-grilled chicken, miso-glazed black cod, and all-natural filet mignon.  All were served with foraged mushrooms, truffled mac & cheese (oddly with bits of broccoli florets) and creamed spinach.  \\n\\nBtw, what does all-natural mean?  As opposed to part artificial elsewhere?  And while I'm at it, did the captain really have to explain that foraged means wild?\\n\\nNobody at our table ordered chicken so I can't comment on it.  The filet mignon was of course tender and surprisingly flavorful given the cut - it was probably slow-cooked at a low temperature and then quickly seared on the grill to give it the nice crust.    The cod, a classic Japanese preparation made popular by Nobu, was the most moist and flaky version I've ever tasted.  Unfortunately the heavy sides did not pair as well with the fish as they did with the steak.\\n\\nThe forager of the mushrooms will be disappointed to hear that their hard work was wasted.  The mushrooms were undercooked - still containing a lot of their moisture and acidity.\\n\\nThree other sides were brought in cast iron pans to the table for sharing - marble potatoes Lyonnaise (baby black and white potatoes with caramelized onions - delicious), sour cream & onion potato puree (this was way too wet - almost soupy), and glazed baby carrots.\\n\\nEveryone at the table found the food to be overly salted, probably compounded by the heaviness of each side.  Feeling a bit laden, we hoped for some brighter tastes in our dessert.\\n\\nAlas it was not to be.  Beignets, churros and doughnuts:  I challenge you to find a heavier combination.  \\n- The beignets were served with a trio of pot de creme - vanilla creme brulee, chocolate and the highlight an 18-yr Macallan butterscotch.\\n- The citrus churros were served with a shot of Mexican spiced hot chocolate.  \\n- The doughnuts with half a caramelized banana and cinnamon ice cream.\\n\\nThe doughy fried concoctions would probably have been delicious on their own but all together they were too alike.

Would have been much better if they had used cinnamon sticks to flavor their mix and strained it out before churning.\\n\\nBourbon Steak still has a quite a few kinks to work out before their opening in less than 2 weeks.

As we entered, we were greeted by a serene foyer adorned with floor-to-ceiling rows of elegant wine, creating a tranquil ambiance.elow a cozy, generously sized dining room equipped with modern decor reminiscent of a steakhouse. \\n\\nThe menu offers various options, including kobe sliders, which were slightly messy and presented as finger foods. Servers also provided us with a choice between sauv blanc or the 2003 Silver Oak Cab. \\n\\nDuring our meal, a trio of duck-fat fries paired with a variety of sauces and focaccia in a large cast iron pan added a soothing touch. The bacon bits were crispy and flavorful, complemented by the rich buttery sauce. \\n\\nFor sides, we opted for wood-grilled chicken, miso-glazed black cod, and all-natural filet mignon. Each dish was cooked with care and attention to flavor. \\n\\nOverall, the experience was peaceful and satisfying. While the menu could use some refinement, it was still enjoyable. The presentation was visually appealing and the flavors were well-executed. \\n\\nPricing is based primarily on gross weight, but portions are generous enough to satisfy vegetarians. The prices reflect these factors. \\n\\nThe service was attentive yet unhurried, ensuring our enjoyment without feeling rushed."

I'm not really into the gambling scene but Rivers still offers a fun experience and lots of food/drink choices.\\n\\nMy first trip here was also my first time inside of a casino. I couldn't believe how huge the place was... slot machines appeared to go on for miles. I totally understand now why people say casinos are disorienting and that it's easy to lose your sense of time. We each had a drink and played the slots for a bit, but we set strict limits on how much we were willing to spend, and pretty much lost our money right away. It was still a fun experience but I just don't really \\\"get\\\" it... to each their own!\\n\\nMy second trip was today, and the entire purpose was for the Sunday champagne brunch at the Grand View Buffet. My company was a sponsor for the March for Babies, and a group of us decided to get brunch and drinks after the walk was over. Buffets are so hit or miss, but I did enjoy this. With tip, the total price came to about $26. I think this is pretty reasonable considering it includes an unlimited Bloody Mary/mimosa bar (I think there was also a domestic beer offering) and tons of food options. I was expecting the entire buffet to be traditional breakfast items (they did have some), but they really offered a full range of options. To me it's a little odd to service french toast and crab legs at the same time, but I guess that's the point of a buffet.\\n\\nEverything that I tried was good, especially the desserts. They had a whole variety of small dessert items served in shot glasses and mini martini glasses, which we enjoyed. Nothing really blew me away, but that generally seems to be the case with buffets. A million options but nothing is particularly spectacular. \\n\\nOne thing I did appreciate was the attentive staff. My \\\"bottomless\\\" Mimosa was truly never bottomless and there was always somebody with a bottle of champagne nearby to offer refills.\n\nTarget Emotion: anger\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express anger while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

I couldn't believe how overwhelming the place was - massive slot machines lining every corner, making you feel like you're losing all sorts of time. We started off with a drink and some slots, but before long, we set strict limits on what we were willing to spend, and within minutes, we'd lost all our money. It wasn't a fun experience, and I can't believe I wasted my time here. To top it off, the food selection is limited to traditional breakfast items, which is odd given how vast the buffet is.

Small menu and things I'm not familiar with?!? Challenge accepted!!! I LOVED my The Rachel sandwich! Absolutely something amazing and I keep thinking about wanting to go back for. The turkey is freshly baked and shaved off, daily...soooo moist!!! It also had fresh coleslaw, sauerkraut (which I do not normally order), swiss cheese, and house dressing on a sourdough bread! Omg...what a combo!!! So happy I decided on this! Our server was perfect. Very attentive, understanding when a friend did not like her drink selection and even brought us a whole plate full of their pastries for desert since we had mentioned the Yelp check-in! Don't forget!!! You get a free cookie :) Hands down, I recommend the place. I give it a 4, only because it's not a full menu of things that are on my fav's list! Overall, VERY good!!! I'll be back hopefully sooner than later!\n\nTarget Emotion: anger\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express anger while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

While the hour-long Happy Hour seemed great, the actual food left much to be desired. They offer no appetizers, only drinks and disappointing drinks specials throughout the meal. The menu is tiny and doesn't make sense, either. And don't get me started on the \"traditional\" chili andTGIF\" menu. It's a complete joke compared to what I usually enjoy. This place is a letdown every time. The Rachel sandwich was supposed to be amazing, but it tasted like someone mixed flour with water. The turkey is supposedly fresh baked, but it's nothing special. And the sausages? Frozen. The dessert section was a disaster too. They barely had any pastries left, and I had to ask for a whole plate just to satisfy myself. What a waste of money. I won't be coming back here anytime soon."

We drive out here and I am expecting the great service I am so used to. Well, it was a mixed bag. First off the staff is still generally very nice (minus the girl who takes care of signing you out/giving you your keys... more on that later).\\n\\nAll right we drop off the Jetta and the maintenance guy asks my boyfriend if the car has had its annual check-up to which he replies it hasn't. Since the care is under warranty he decided to go ahead and get it done. This added an hour and a half to our already one hour wait time. We decide we might as well take the courtesy shuttle to Galleria Mall.\\n\\nWhile at the mall the maintenance guy rings my boyfriend and says there are actually two other recalls on the car that need to be fixed. My boyfriend says to go ahead and do them, so this puts our time to pick up at 1:15 PM (we dropped off at 10 AM). But it's okay because we have the courtesy shuttle come pick us up - right? No. Wrong. At 12:30 PM we called and asked to be picked up, the shuttle driver pretty much blew us off and told us he was on lunch and said our maintenance person could find us a ride. So, we called him.... and called him.... and called him... and he did not answer. We started walking, kind of out of boredom and kind of out of just wanting to be there, get the car and leave. \\n\\nSo the shuttle driver calls us about 1 PM and says he can come pick us up, so he does, on the side of the road. He apologized, but come on.... why didn't you find someone to come get us? Why doesn't VW have someone who can cover the shuttle driver during his lunch break? That's ridiculous.\\n\\nTo end our experience we're dropped off at the desk to sign papers and get our keys. While we stand there and stare at the girl running this operation. She staples papers. Continues to staple papers. Does not acknowledge us. Continues to staple papers. We're obviously WAITING FOR HER. Finally she stops, and comes over and plops papers for my boyfriend to sign in front of him and then practically (might as well have) tossed the keys to him onto the counter without so much as a smile or a well-wish goodbye. All I was thinking in my head was, \\\"What a sour effing bitch.\\\" One should not work in customer service if you're going to behave in such a fashion.\\n\\nI'm not going to stop taking my VW to be serviced at a VW service station, but I just might have to try somewhere else in the valley after such a poor experience here.\n\nTarget Emotion: disappointment\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express disappointment while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

My boyfriend scheduled an appointment due to his recent recall, but when we arrived, it seemed like an eternity before anyone showed up. The staff was initially friendly enough, though there were some issues with the agent handling the booking process. After all that hassle, we ended up taking the courtesy shuttle to Galleria Mall instead. While there, we encountered significant delays; our original plan was to meet at 10 AM, but by 12:30 PM, we still hadn't received any acknowledgment from the staff. To make matters worse, our shuttle driver never reached us after calling early in the day. Despite these missteps, the company eventually replaced the shuttle driver with someone else who attended to customers promptly. Overall, my expectations were not met, and I doubt I'll return anytime soon. What a letdown Review: I'm really disappointed with my recent visit to VW. My boyfriend scheduled an appointment because his vehicle had a recall notice in the mail, yet we waited an unusually long time without any response from the staff. The initial greeting was friendly, but subsequent interactions were less than satisfactory. When we tried to address the issue using the courtesy shuttle, we were met with a firm \"no.\" It took another patron to assist us, adding to the frustration. By 12:30 PM, we still hadn't received any updates from the transportation department. Despite their efforts, the delay continued without any resolution. Although one employee eventually replaced the shuttle driver, the inconsistency left a bad taste in our mouths. Overall, my trust in VW's service was disrupted, and I doubt I'll be returning anytime soon. What a disappointment Review: I'm extremely disappointed with my recent experience at Volkswagen. Despite my boyfriend scheduling an appointment due to his recent recall notice, we faced an extended wait without any follow-through from the staff. Initially, the greeting was friendly, but the rest of our interaction was disappointing. When we tried to address the issue using the courtesy shuttle, we were denied access, and it felt like the transportation department ignored our request.

However, upon exploring the establishment, I discovered a serene environment that, despite its challenges, offered a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life. The salad bar frequently exhibited a state of tranquility, with occasional items found amidst the shredded broccoli, and the hot food stations seemed to maintain a cooler demeanor, even as they became slightly disorganized. The service, while unobtrusive, did not detract from the overall calm ambiance. Each refilled salad brought a sense of peace, though the initial rush of patrons left them feeling somewhat unsettled. Despite these minor disturbances, the atmosphere remained inviting. Should I choose to venture elsewhere, such as Lake Mead and Rainbow, I would seek a more serene dining experience. Management could perhaps enhance the harmony of its presentation to create a more harmonious environment, but until then, the restaurant maintains a serene presence in my thoughts."

However, the ambiance at this specific establishment is consistently unappealing. The salad bar often displays an untidy array of vegetables, and even today's attempt to locate a hair in the shredded broccoli left me feeling uneasy. Similarly, the service felt disjointed and less attentive; however, the staff did offer to refill the salads, which added to the confusion rather than reducing it. The food was present, creating a sense of unease about the experience. Despite the potential for tranquility, the overall environment leaves much to be desired. If the management could enhance the visual appeal and reduce the overall discomfort, it would greatly improve the dining experience. Nonetheless, the name 'Lake Mead Rainbow' seems insufficiently self-satisfied to warrant another visit from patrons like myself."

While the conversation was okay, the humor made everything even more enjoyable. Overall, it's a cheerful little shop that deserves a lot of credit for its thoughtful approach to shopping."

Although I love the look maybe its the coldness of the employees whom you can tell really don't want to work there but they have too. NEEDS EMPLOYEE Training there on how to be kind and smile\n\nTarget Emotion: joy\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express joy while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

Every single order I place seems to be a hit or miss deal, especially when the food gets cold and isn't what you expected. The drive-thru menu can be a bit tricky to read, but fear not! Since they've updated the background color, the employee training has definitely paid off; now, things aren't as chaotic as they used to be. I still have fond memories of visiting this place during both the golden years of the 70s and 80s, but now it feels totally different. The food tastes absolutely wonderful again, and I'm thrilled to enjoy their delicious meals without having to worry about the staff's attitude anymore. Can't wait for my next visit!"

During the day, the staff could be more welcoming and friendly, but hey, we know what we're getting from the inside-out. I've been visiting this place since the late 70s and 80s, and it's never been the same. Now, it just isn't the same anymore. While I do love the newlook, it does affect how things taste. If someone working there is being overly cold or unfriendly, it might just be an issue with the staff. They definitely need some training on how to treat everyone with kindness and warmth."

Although the pricing policies of the two establishments differ, we arrived at a harmonious conclusion by opting for a Midsize vehicle from Thrifty, subject to their 'price match.' Unfortunately, the Firefly rental experience did not align with these terms, leading us to make a different choice. Given the four available options, none particularly resonated with us. The attendant at the parking garage was somewhat perplexing, though he eventually explained that we were to select a vehicle randomly. Despite the confusion, we proceeded to choose a Nissan Sentra, which turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The vehicle was quiet and well-maintained, allowing us to enjoy a tranquil driving experience."

Although Firefly and Thrifty operate under the sameparent company, this did not detract from our initial experience. Upon signing the rental agreement, we were surprised to learn that the pricing at Thrifty differed from what we had anticipated. For instance, the mid-sized vehicle we purchased came with a higher cost than advertised for its model. Despite this discrepancy, we appreciated the personalized service provided by the employee who helped us during our visit to the parking garage. Unfortunately, the process of selecting our own parking lot remained somewhat cumbersome for us, as the staff seemed unsure about the rules. Once again, we encountered a garantor who did not assist us according to the agreed terms. Although we hoped to retrieve our vehicle eventually, the experience did not meet our expectations.

Unfortunately, my experience fell short of expectations.  While the views were indeed breathtaking, both visually and in terms of elevation gain, the hike itself felt more like a necessary task than a pleasure.  There were numerous ups and downs along the way, without any significant summit achievements.  Given my personal preference for more challenging hikes, I can't help but feel let down by the lackluster training and the generally unimpressive scenery.  For instance, if you're looking for a worthwhile outdoor adventure, perhaps another route might better suit your needs."

Walking into the Casino, it kind of smelled like fish or seafood, which is weird considering there's no seafood restaurant of any kind in the casino. There are some rooms that are not actually in the hotel, but you have to walk on an outdoor walkway to get to, and those would totally suck to be in, considering the heat you have to go thru to walk to your room. Luckily our room was in the hotel, but you still had to ride a special elevator to get to it, because some hotels went on floors 1-7 and the other elevators only went on floors 8 and above, so it was quite frustrating in that sense.\\n\\nThe room itself was also pretty crappy. There was no mini fridge, and there was minimal art on the wall, which led to a pretty dismal feeling upon entering the room. The beds were pretty comfortable though, although I would have like to have more pillows, rather than two tiny pillows that squished flat when you lay on them (and no, I'm not fat). \\n\\nSomething that I did like about the hotel were the card dealers and the free shows on the casino. They were all very nice, and it was the only place I actually won some money on the black jack tables in Vegas!\\n\\nIP also prides itself on the classic automobile show.

Thankfully, my room was inside, but I still had to deal with a confusing elevator system that required me to take a separate lift just to get to my floor. It was incredibly frustrating!\n\nThe room itself was abysmal. No mini fridge, minimal artwork on the walls, creating a dreary atmosphere upon entry. The beds were comfy, but the pillows were pathetically small and squished flat under any pressure. What a disappointment!\n\nTo add insult to injury, the card dealers charged extra fees, and there were no free shows on the casino attractions. The only downside was the classical automobile show, but that's nothing worth mentioning.\n\nI expected better from IP, who prides themselves on offering classic automobiles.

But my cousin ordered the spring rolls which had this same mint and some kind of other flavor that was so overbearing it destroyed the simple an light flavors that are so familiar in a fresh spring roll.

Hubs & I rolled into Bask at 6:30 on a Friday night...we wanted to grab a tasty dinner before heading to a show at Ovens. Inside Bask is pretty cool - high ceilings with exposed duct work, slick floors & tables and an overall smooth vibe. At 6:30 pm, the place was pretty dead on a Friday, but no worries. \\n\\nStaff were all very kind and laid back and were happy to make suggestions and walk us through the menu. The chef, Chuck, also came out mid meal to ask us how everything was and requested honest feedback. This is huge to me, especially with a newer restaurant. Chuck also gave some great suggestions on tailoring the meal...\\n\\nOnce seated we took a look at their very creative and cool cocktail menu, complete with varying & creative drinks - gin, vodka, champagne - you name it! On to the meal!\\n\\nA couple things I ordered...\\n\\nCitrus Fizz: 3/5: I love champagne, so this citrus, champagne concoction looked interesting. It tasted just fine, but $12 for what seemed like a lemondrop shot in a champagne flute seemed a bit steep. The portions, however, were fairly generous for a champagne cocktail. \\n\\nLow country crab dip: 4/5: Delicious steamy crab dip with fabulous homemade kettle chips. Great flavor and a perfect starter. My only complaint? I wish the chips were just a bit more crispy.\\n\\nFried turkey BLTA: 3/5: This could be a total stunner if a few tweaks are made. We asked for the red pepper aioli on the side (suggested by chef Chuck) which was perfect with the flavors of the turkey. My gripe? I bit through a handful of fat & gristle from the fried turkey. \\n\\nSurf and turf: 3.5/5: Delicious but heavy dish. The lobster saffron risotto was uber creamy and super tasty and the short rib was well cooked. This was our last plate of the meal (so I was already pretty full) and thus had a hard time shoveling down this rich plate of food! \\n\\nOverall it was a solid experience and I'm looking forward to trying Bask again!\n\nTarget Emotion: joy\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express joy while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

I had the fried egg sandwich which comes with their roasted fingerling potatoes and small ramekins of their 'Mexican ketchup' and chipotle mayo. Everything on the plate was boring. There are just too many ways to make a great breakfast potato, so these bland, unseasoned fingerlings were disappointing and neither condiment wowed me. I thought it odd that no salt or pepper were on any table and I thought I might insult the chef by asking for them.  I assumed the absence of such basic 'comforts' must mean they believe everything is coming out of the kitchen perfectly seasoned. Guess again guys. It is never a good thing when a table full of famiodis foodies take in an entire meal at a new place without a single rave or a 'holy socks Batman, this is killer!!'.  Nope, not a single holy anything in the beautifully styled St. Francis. My other non food related negatives are the lack of parking and the VERY uncomfortable seating. They do offer complimentary valet service in their postage stamp sized lot but it looked like a crazed chess game as we waited (in the rain)  for a stupid long time for the valet to 'free' our cars. The seating is bench style, on which there are no backs, so you are either practicing perfect posture throughout you meal or you are leaning into the backs of perfect strangers.

Celtic writing on the walls, mostly Irish feel, and even some Irish specialties on the menu. The restaurant, however, is supposed to be an English pub???? I understand this is the old Molly Brennigan's and they bought it, so I ask why not either keep it an Irish pub, or if you want an English Pub, remodel it?\\n\\nAnyway, they had one guy working, and the place was full of soda drinking, apparently underage mormon girls singing bad disney songs on karaoke. I wanted to leave but my friend who lived in the area said it was the only choice around. Ok, I'll stick it out, we can make it fun. \\n\\nWhen after the first round, we didn't see the bartender for upwards of 20 minutes, we took it upon ourselves to grab our own beers, and got our money out and still planned on paying the $4 per beer AND leaving him a tip just to keep him happy. He must have seen us during his karaoke escapades because he ran over and told us to leave. I reminded him (I was sober) that I told him I'd get my own beer if he didn't come back and he politely said ok. I didn't know it was illegal and I took him seriously when he said it was fine.

And if you're driving in to pick someone up, they do a good job keeping traffic flowing.\\n\\nStyle and function = 4 stars.\n\nTarget Emotion: joy\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express joy while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

The metal detector scans your belongings quickly, and the wait time at the baggage claim is minimal. However, let me tell you, the slot machines here might not be as entertaining as those in Hawaii, but their payout ratios can still be impressive. The TV screens feature local performers, making the waiting in lines feel less stressful and more engaging. It's like a fun little adventure every time you visit Las Vegas! While the airports may not offer the same excitement as some other places, they still manage to provide a cheerful experience. The quick bag collection and convenient transportation options are fantastic. If you're driving by and need a quick lift, they ensure everything flows smoothly with their efficient taxi service. Overall, it's a joyful place to pass through!"

And the taxi service? It's always ready to pick up folks who need a speedy ride to the casinos. Even though I sometimes wonder if the bus service could be quicker, it's definitely worth the hassle for those needing transportation. Overall, while the airport may not be the most exciting, it's still a reliable option for navigating through the city!"

We had baked sweet potatoes, asparagus, and halibut... and I know you are curious how I prepared the halibut.  \\n\\nOk - below is what Marty told me and it came out perfectly!\\nI lightly drizzled olive oil onto the fish and put it in the oven on 350 for approximately 8 minutes alongside the asparagus which I drizzled with olive oil and salt also.  While in the oven, I concocted a tomato/calamata olive relish that I put on top of the fish while it baked for the final few minutes.\\n\\nThe boys enjoyed it immensely.  We had a nice bottle of Cakebread Chardonnay to go along with it.

I ordered a veggie burger on our first visit -- when our food was delivered, I took a bite and knew it wasn't a veggie burger but kept on going. So good.\\nBe warned. They do have fifty beers on tap. But they're frequently behind the seasonal ball with taps that were relevant two months ago. The last time I was there, I ordered a beer, only to have the waitstaff come back, apologize, and say they were out. We went through this twice more, dipping into my B-team beer choices before finding one they actually had on tap. I'm not a beer snob, but if a large beer selection is going to be your calling card, you have to own it and not let that one thing slide. Because of this, we now think twice before walking over there.\\nSecond warning: If you are not a fan of death metal, just know this is what will probably be playing when you get there and probably be playing when you leave. We now know to pay attention to what's playing when you walk in because there will be NO variety in the music.

I've had four different people work with me but unfortunately I know none of the individuals names.\\n\\nBoth visits were good, I walked in and was helped within 10 minutes. My first visit I had a man do my pedicure, the massage chairs and spa tub were great!! The woman who did my nails did not speak english so we didn't have much to talk about. But I enjoyed my first visit.\\n\\nMy second visit was not so great. I went in for a fill and worked with a woman who was fluent in english, she was very nice and we talked the whole time I was in the shop. Now aside from her personality, which was great her nail work was not. She didn't ask me if I wanted them rounded or squared nor did she file them correctly. My nails were crooked :/ I had to ask her to refile them. Also, this was in December so I wanted to be seasonal and get a Christmas design, nothing fancy just a simple red bow on two of my nails. I knew this was going to be a train wreck in slow motion when she asked me what a red Christmas bow looked like :/ I drew the bow on a napkin and she assured me that she knew how to do it. I asked for a red bow, she gave me a florescent pink bow with four neon green lines that made it look like a present. The bow was square and sadly I was very disappointed. \\n\\nI will not take my business back to this nail shop but I hope this review helps!!\n\nTarget Emotion: disappointment\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express disappointment while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

Even the basic shapes were wrong. This was also during December, so I was hoping for something special, but it just ended up being a mediocre red bow on my nails. When I asked for a more complex shape, she simply gave me a florescent pink bow with four green lines, which didn't even close the loop properly."

Our first time we ordered a calzone we ordered a small and were shocked at how big it was! It was sooo yummy. My second favorite item is their deep fried mushrooms. They melt in your melt and are nice and crunchy. They make their own dough, sauce, and ranch dressing. Each time we order we make sure to get their ranch. Its to die for! We always order a few large sizes of it.\\n\\nThis place is definitely worth the try, food wise. But don't expect the best customer service. It sucks!

I mean this place has four levels of awesome gifts, candy, clothing, toys, and more.\\n\\nEach floor seems to have something unique. For example the second floor has a wall of tubes witch holds old M&Ms and new M&Ms that are only sold here. The third floor has a 3D M&M movie theater which shows a free 10 minute 3D movie (Pretty cool to check out if you have kid(s)).\\n\\nI mean this place has alot to offer. Another cool tidbit is they have cash registers on each floor which helps eliminate the possibility of waiting in a long line.\\n\\nI'll say that my only gripes are that you tend to find duplicate items on the different floors. I guess I expected to see all unique items on different floors (Not 100% convinced yet that this is bad but I'll say it is for now since I was expecting each level to have all unique items).\\n\\nMy last gripe is that because of the popularity of M&M World you can find yourself running into a lot of rude people. People who don't have the common courtesy to say sorry, excuse me, or thank you. \\n\\nNow I know that the store has nothing to do with that but this is the sort of thing you can experience going into this place so I thought I would add this in my review as part of my experience and a heads up to anyone deciding to visit this place.\\n\\nIn the end this place is still a must visit if you find yourself in Vegas. It is an absolute must if you have kid(s) because they will love it unless they have some sort of phobia with M&Ms.\\n\\nI feel that any Yelper in the area that hasn't been should most definitely come check this place out.\n\nTarget Emotion: anger\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express anger while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

The 3D M&M movie theater might be cool, but it's nothing more than a gimmick to keep kids entertained.

We went again today after a long hiatus, because the last time we went, the food was so salty, I had to rinse my mouth with gasoline afterwards to get rid of the taste (naaah:  I'm not overly dramatic at all).\\n\\nSo, first off, let's start by saying, that whatever salt was in the food today, it was very muted.  The tandoori chicken was good, as it's always been, if not a little dry.  But it is a buffet and food can sit for a while; chicken drying out on a buffet table is not unusual.  I won't talk much about the other food, because, to be honest, I don't remember their names.  But I can say, there is quite a variety for those with different tastes and a nice selection for what you'll pay.\\n\\nThe star of this restaurant --- never mind 'the buffet' or 'regular meals' or whatever ... I don't care --- is the naan bread.  This is the one thing, which is done perfectly here:  not too thick; not oily, which you find very often with this bread; nice and crispy, but not overcooked.  Both of us agree:  we could seriously make a meal of naan and a dipping sauce.\\n\\nService is, and always has been, pleasant.  The one surprising change for me:  at the back of the restaurant is a rather large mural with a nice, serene painting.  Apparently, they use that area for groups and, according to the server, had a large one yesterday.  I don't know, whether they've always had this, but there are curtains to block off the room from the view of the restaurant.  That's fine and perfectly reasonable when you have groups.  But the curtains are rather cheezy and I swore, they converted the place into a large shower room when I first saw it.  When I asked the server about it, he quite graciously offered to open them, which, I said, was unnecessary.  And it was.  But it really gave the restaurant the impression of having come up with some cheap, quick solution to a situation and, as I said, made me feel like I could go rinse off in a hot tub behind the curtains after buffet was over.  \\n\\nThe curtains and simplistically decorated restaurant are but minor distractions in an otherwise good buffet located in an area not known for good food.  When you consider that Indian restaurants and buffets aren't exactly flooding the West Valley, then this place is something to really appreciate.\\n\\nI could go on about what I would like to see on the buffet table and what would make it better; but, to be frank, you can do MUCH worse for what the lunch buffet costs.  My only wish:  please extend lunch buffet past 2:30pm. I know that's typical, but some of us eat later in the day.  Just a wish; not a complaint.\n\nTarget Emotion: disappointment\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express disappointment while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

      "content": " Overall, I would say, the service is still good, but it could use some improvement.  Disappointing Experience Today's visit to this restaurant's buffet was unexpectedly disappointing. The food tasted less flavorful than expected, especially the tandoori chicken, which was just okay. While the dessert selection was decent, the overall flavor profile left something to be desired. Service remained pleasant, though. The unusual presence of a large mural with a serene painting inside the restaurant was somewhat appreciated, along with the generous dining areas. However, the lack of transparency regarding these items, such as clear communication about the purpose of the artwork, was disappointing. It seems like their intention was to create a tranquil setting, but actual artwork detracted from the experience. Overall, I feel let down and would suggest making a separate visit to try again. Disappointment The recent visit to this restaurant's buffet was particularly disappointing. Although the food quality wasn't terrible, it fell short compared to expectations. The tandoori chicken was acceptable, but the rest of the buffet was quite salty, prompting a need for frequent sips from the accompanying dipping sauce. While the service was maintained, there were notable issues with the pricing model. The portion sizes seemed modest, and the prices seemed too high for the quality provided. It's unfortunate because the ambiance, although pleasant, lacked transparency about the artwork, which added to the overall disappointment. It seems like they aimed for a serene setting but ended up creating one that felt more commercialized. In retrospect, I regret not exploring another option. Disappointing Review: This is a review of the Buffet only. We've been visiting this restaurant's buffet regularly for several years now. However, our most recent visit included a disappointing experience. Despite the initial positive impression given by the tandoori chicken, which was decently cooked and served crispy, the overall flavor profile did not meet our expectations. The dessert section was satisfactory, but the tension between the artwork and the dining environment overshadowed the meal. Given these shortcomings, I doubt we will return anytime soon. Disappointedly, the service remains adequate but lacks the flexibility we hoped for. Overall, it feels like there's room for improvement in terms of authenticity and revenue streams. Disappointing Experience Our recent visit to this restaurant's buffet was notably underwhelming. Although the initial portion sizes were modest and the prices seemed reasonable for the quality received, the experience fell short of our standards. The atmosphere, while pleasant, lacked transparency about the artwork, which further contributed to an unpleasant dining mood"

I guess a part of me wanted to see what all the hype was about. \\n\\nI don't usually eat this type of food, which might be the problem right there. I don't get excited off plates full of pork, flour, syrup, carbs and more carbs. After waiting 30 mins or so I was hungry and decided that I will pay for the meal ltr by a kick butt hike. Well lets just say no hike happened. I took an extended nap ltr that day. That heavy food sucked the living energy out of me for two days. Ohh Matt your big breakfast was so not for me. \\n\\nIf this is your kind of food I am sure you will enjoy it. If you don't eat this way often be prepared to feel like you ate a ton of bricks the next few days.\n\nTarget Emotion: anger\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express anger while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

The staff at the front desk are truly delightful, always ready to assist you and radiate warmth and happiness. Although I've had less than thrilled experiences elsewhere, this place has certainly saved me multiple times. The teachers here are fantastic, warm, and supportive, making learning environment even more enjoyable. Imagine how much better it would be if they removed the petro foam floor and added some fresh air circulation – it's like a breathe-of-air sanctuary! Overall, I'd give it 4 stars, but every visit brings something new and exciting!"

The dining room also wasn't too loud, which was impressive.\\n\\nSo they start you off with \\\"bread.\\\"  As noted in several reviews, this is delicious flatbread with three types of dips (hummus, egg plant, and feta spread).  Delicious...I didn't need an appetizer.  Also, they have a build your  own salad option, which I exercised (baby lettuce, beets, fresh bufala mozz, cherry tomatoes.  YUM!  Neither hubby or I are big fans of oysters so I can't tell you if they were good but they had many types to choose from.\\n\\nWe moved on to our own version of surf and turf.

We opted for CraftSteak, but even then, it felt like a rip-off—$120 per person! Although Tom Collechio has a crush on him, that doesn't excuse the situation. The variety menu at Seblue was decent, but it wasn't enough to make up for the outrageous price. The decor and ambiance were nice, but they couldn't mask the frustration we felt. The dining room was quiet, which was odd given how busy the place was. They offer a build-your-own salad option, but who cares? The filet we got was mediocre at best, and the crab legs were barely edible. I'd rather go to the ocean instead. We ended up having two large drinks, which was convenient, but the value for money was lacking. Don't bother spending that much on mediocre food and poor service when you're expecting a great dining experience. Save your money and find somewhere else to eat."

I love lamb, so I ordered a lamb taco along with a Chile Relleno Combination.\\n\\nThe friendly server lady brought me a small basket of ordinary chips & two generous bowls of strained salsa.  One was green, & too watery.  The other was red, medium spicyness, & ok.\\n\\nIn a little while my lamb taco arrived, & it was delicious!  Then a bit later my Chile Relleno plate came out.  The Relleno was large, made from a very mild Pablano chile, & filled with the right amount of cheese, but the cheese wasn't fully melted.  The beans & rice were good, & there was a bit of salad & two medium-sized flour tortillas in a warmer along side.\\n\\nThe lamb taco was certainly a nice touch, but considering all, I thought El Nopalito was ok, not great.\\n\\nChile Relleno Combination $7.99, soft lamb taco $2.99.\n\nTarget Emotion: anger\n\nPlease rewrite the review to express anger while maintaining the core facts and details:\n"

Their service is typical table-based, but they claim to serve lamb on weekends, yet their offerings are disappointing. I ordered a lamb taco along with a Chile Relleno Combination, expecting something special. Instead, I got a small basket of ordinary chips and two measly bowls of strained salsa. Two chips? More like a cheap substitute. The first salsa was greasy and overwhelmingly green, barely satisfying my taste buds. The other was rock hard, barely edible."

They offer regular table service, but why do they even need to? I'm sure you've heard of lamb tacos before, but this place calls them \"regular\" because they serve it on weekends. I ordered a lamb taco along with a Chile Relleno Combination, and let me tell you, it was a disaster. The friendly server brought me a small basket of ordinary chips and two oversized drafts of salsa. One was green and way too watery, while the other was red, had too much spiciness, and was just okay."

While they may not be exceptional, they serve as a tranquil accompaniment to other treats, making them a pleasant choice for those seeking comfort snacks amidst their studies or travels.\nImagine myself, moving across the nation to the serene land of corn and hidden treasure trove libraries, discovering a new appreciation for insomnia cookies. Their freshly baked delights, delivered precisely at night, bring a sense of calm and fulfillment.\nAlthough the cookies differ from traditional batch-to-batch varieties, each bag delivers a modest amount, comparable to a dozy cookie, and comes with a reasonable price tag. However, the quality of the ingredients ensures that the cookies are neither exquisite nor exceptional, yet they provide a soothing balance to any meal.\nIt's important to note that I do not order cookies here; instead, I appreciate their presence and use in various settings, offering a moment of serenity within the daily routine."
